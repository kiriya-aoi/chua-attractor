chua-attractor
================

An interactive web based demonstration of chaos in Chua's circuit. Default settings run through the double scroll attractor.

You need to install the flot jquery graphing plugin under 'flot/' for this code to work. See: http://www.flotcharts.org/ . You also need to install jquery-ui to 'jquery-ui/'. See: http://jqueryui.com/

Having done this, you just need to copy to a directory inside your web root, and set the file permissions right for your system.

There is an online demo of the program working at: https://kiriya-aoi.github.io/chua-attractor/attractor.html.

See the repository this was forked from for the original work on the Lorenz attractor by Andrew Baxter <andy@highfellow.org> 2012.
